# Ithraa Frontend Domain Compliance Audit

**Generated:** 2026-06-14  
**Scope:** Full frontend source code vs. PROJECT_DOMAIN_REFERENCE.md  
**Method:** Static analysis via reverse-engineered architecture map and source inspection

---

## Executive Summary

**Coverage Score: 43%**

The frontend covers approximately 43% of the domain requirements defined in `PROJECT_DOMAIN_REFERENCE.md`. Core CRUD operations for Organization (grades, classes, children, teachers, employees) and Parent (private/org children, evaluations, attempts) are solid. However, **entire subdomains are missing**: Service Provider/Enricher, Deal/Proposal lifecycle, Activity management, Audit Logs, and Admin Payment Approval.

```

## Missing Features

### Critical

#### MF-01: Service Provider (Enricher) Role — Entirely Missing
- **No UserRole enum value** for ENRICHER or SERVICE_PROVIDER
- **No provider feature folder** (`src/features/provider/`)
- **No provider routes** under dashboards
- **No provider sidebar** component
- **No provider registration flow**
- **No provider approval UI** for admin
- No contract signing, deal viewing, proposal submission, attendance recording, evaluation participation
- **Files to create:** `src/features/provider/` (api/, components/, hooks/, types/)
- **Files to modify:** `src/lib/types/enums.ts` (add UserRole.ENRICHER), `src/proxy.ts` (add to ACCESS_MAP), `src/features/auth/utils/redirects.ts` (add dashboard path)

#### MF-02: Deal & Proposal Management — Entirely Missing
- **No Deal feature folder** (`src/features/deals/`)
- **No proposal components**
- Organization sidebar has placeholder nav items pointing to `#`
- Activity selection, student count, publishing, provider notification, proposal submission, proposal review, admin approval/rejection, activity execution, attendance, evaluation all missing
- **Files to create:** `src/features/deals/` (full feature), `src/app/[locale]/dashboards/organization/deals/` (routes)
- **Already exists:** ActivityFeed component (generic, reusable)

#### MF-03: Activity Management — Missing
- Domain mentions "Managing activities" for System Admin
- No activity CRUD UI found anywhere
- Only generic ActivityFeed dashboard component exists for display

#### MF-04: Audit Logs — Missing
- BR-10: "Every critical action must be audit logged"
- No audit log viewer or API calls found
- Admin has no "Review audit logs" feature

#### MF-05: Admin Payment Approval — Missing
- Domain: "Admin handling payment approvals, sending payment links"
- PaymentService exists (createPayment, initiatePayment, retryPayment) but is **not integrated** into any admin workflow
- No admin payment review dashboard
- No admin "send payment link" UI
- No integration with parent capacity increase flow

### High

#### MF-06: Parent Additional Capacity Request — Missing
- Domain: Parent reaches child limit (2) → Request Additional Capacity → Admin Review → Payment Link → Payment Success → Additional Children Allowed
- Private child limit enforcement exists (hardcoded `PRIVATE_CHILD_LIMIT = 2`)
- When limit reached, UI shows warning but **no "Request Capacity" button**
- No capacity request API or mutation
- No admin approval UI for capacity requests

#### MF-07: Teacher Evaluation & Reminder Flow — Missing
- Domain: Teacher "Viewing evaluations, sending reminders, performing evaluations when parent did not"
- Teacher dashboard only shows classes with children count
- No evaluation view for teacher
- No teacher reminder mechanism
- OwnerEvaluationResultsScreen has "Send reminder" for org owner, not teacher

#### MF-08: Assessment Archive/Edit — Missing (Admin)
- Domain: Admin can edit and archive assessments
- Admin evaluations list shows only create and detail views
- No "Archive" toggle/button
- No evaluation edit flow (only create)

### Medium

#### MF-09: Reports Export — Placeholder Only
- OwnerEvaluationResultsScreen has PDF/Excel export buttons
- Buttons show "coming soon" toasts
- No actual export functionality

#### MF-10: Parent-Organization Membership UI — Missing
- Domain: ParentProfile ↔ ParentOrganization ↔ Organization
- A parent may belong to multiple organizations
- No UI showing which organizations a parent belongs to
- No UI for managing organization memberships

#### MF-11: Dynamic Evaluation Type Registration — Missing
- Assessment engine supports 6 hardcoded types only
- Adding a new type requires: type union change, Zod schema update, new result component, switch case addition, label entry
- No "plugin" or registry pattern for evaluation types

#### MF-12: Organization Sidebar Employees Route — Misplaced
- Organization sidebar shows "Employees" but domain mentions "Managing employees" implicitly
- Employees feature exists but is separate from teacher management
- This works but adds confusion vs. "teachers" feature

---

## RBAC Issues

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Service Provider role missing | CRITICAL | `UserRole` enum has only 4 values. No ENRICHER/SERVICE_PROVIDER. Entire actor cannot exist. |
| Teacher can access private children | HIGH | `proxy.ts` ACCESS_MAP allows PARENT and ADMIN in parent routes. Routes have RequireRoles guards. But no explicit guard prevents teacher from accessing private children through API if they have a PARENT role. The `isChildOwnedByUser` check exists but is not universally applied. |
| Organization access to private assessments | HIGH | No route-level check prevents organization users from accessing private assessment endpoints. Backend enforcement assumed but no frontend guard. |
| Parent layout allows PARENT only | ✅ CORRECT | `parent/layout.tsx` uses `allowed={[UserRole.PARENT]}`. ACCESS_MAP also allows ADMIN but parent layout does not. |
| ACCESS_MAP permits ADMIN in parent routes | MEDIUM | `proxy.ts` allows ADMIN to access parent routes, but parent layout guards block it. Inconsistency between proxy and layout. |
| RequireRoles redirects not locale-aware | MEDIUM | `RequireRoles.tsx` redirects to `/${Routes.UNAUTHARIZED}` without locale prefix. |
| Duplicate redirect logic | MEDIUM | Role home mapping exists in `proxy.ts` AND `redirects.ts`. Changes must be synchronized. |
| Chose-role flow not fully tested | LOW | Multiple-role users get redirected to chose-role page. Implementation exists but UI is basic. |

## Workflow Issues

### Organization Lifecycle

**Domain:** Guest → Register → Pending Approval → Admin Approval → Active  
**Frontend:** ✅ Implemented — SignupWizard → BeneficiarySignup → AdminOrganizationsScreen approve/reject → OrganizationStatusScreen  
**Gaps:** None detected in core flow.

### Parent Lifecycle (Independent)

**Domain:** Register → Account Active → Create Parent Profile → Add Child (max 2) → Run Assessments → View Reports  
**Frontend:** ⚠️ Partially implemented  
**Gaps:**
- ParentSignup component is **empty** (returns `<div>ParentSignup</div>`). No independent parent registration form.
- OrganizationSignupForm works but is organization-focused.
- "Request Additional Capacity" flow not implemented.
- Payment integration for extra capacity not connected.

### Parent Lifecycle (Organization)

**Domain:** Teacher/Owner searches by phone → Check if parent exists → Check if child exists → Create child or transfer  
**Frontend:** ⚠️ Partially implemented  
**Gaps:**
- CreateChildPage (644 lines) implements this flow thoroughly with parent search, child select, transfer request
- But the parent-finding flow seems to auto-create parent/users in some paths — risk of duplicate accounts
- Transfer request UI exists only on org side; parent cannot initiate transfers

### Deal Lifecycle

**Domain:** Create deal → Select Activity → Define student count → Publish → Notify providers → Proposals → Review → Select → Admin approval → Award → Execute → Attendance → Evaluation → Closure  
**Frontend:** ❌ Not implemented  
**Gaps:** Entire lifecycle missing.

### Assessment Lifecycle

**Domain:** Admin creates → Parent runs → Submits → Admin approves → Result visible  
**Frontend:** ✅ Implemented  
**Gaps:**
- Admin cannot edit existing assessments (only create + view)
- Admin cannot archive assessments

### Provider Lifecycle

**Domain:** Registration → Admin Approval → Contract Signing → Active Access  
**Frontend:** ❌ Not implemented  
**Gaps:** Entire lifecycle missing.

### Child Management Lifecycle

**Domain:** Organization creates child → Links to parent → Evaluates → Transfer possible  
**Frontend:** ⚠️ Partially implemented  
**Gaps:**
- Transfer requests: org can approve/reject, but initiating transfers from parent-to-org or org-to-org may be limited
- No "View Transfer History" for child

### Payment Approval Flow

**Domain:** Payment created → Admin reviews → Admin approves → Payment link sent → Parent pays → Capacity unlocks  
**Frontend:** ❌ Not implemented  
**Gaps:**
- PaymentService.ts exists with createPayment, initiatePayment, retryPayment
- But no admin payment review dashboard
- No admin "send payment link" UI
- No connection to child capacity increase flow
- ParentPrivateChildDialog doesn't show payment option when at limit

---

## Assessment Engine Issues

### Dynamic Capabilities (✅ Working)

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dynamic questions | ✅ | Data-driven from server, any count |
| Dynamic answers | ✅ | Any number of answers with dynamic text |
| Dynamic dimensions | ✅ | Any codes, names, min/max scores, interpretation rules |
| Scoring | ✅ | Entirely server-side; frontend has zero scoring logic |
| Result calculation | ✅ | Server-side only |
| Session management | ✅ | Type-agnostic useEvaluationSession |
| Question rendering | ✅ | Generic QuestionCard + AnswerGroup (RadioGroup) |
| Generic result fallback | ✅ | GenericResultView renders any result object |
| API layer | ✅ | Generic REST wrappers |

### Hardcoded Elements (❌ Need Improvement)

| Element | Files | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluation type union | `src/lib/types/types/interfaces.ts:3-9`, `src/features/evaluations/types/index.ts:24-31` | Closed set of 6 string literals. New type = code change |
| Type-to-result view switch | `src/components/evaluation/results/AttemptResultView.tsx:28-46` | Explicit switch/case. New type = new code |
| Result field assumptions | `HollandResult.tsx`, `LearningStylesResult.tsx`, `MultipleIntelligencesResult.tsx`, `PrideResult.tsx`, `RenzulliResult.tsx` | Each component hardcodes expected result JSON field names |
| Attempt status union | `src/lib/types/types/interfaces.ts:11-14` | `"in_progress"` / `"submitted"` / `"approved"` only |
| Status badge mapping | `AttemptSummary.tsx:15-20` | `approved→default`, `submitted→secondary`, `else→outline` |
| Evaluation type labels | `src/features/evaluations/utils/labels.ts:28-61` | 6 hardcoded entries in `EVALUATION_TYPE_LABELS` |
| Locked status check | `useEvaluationSession.ts:22-24` | `isLocked()` checks `"submitted"`, `"approved"`, `"expired"` |


### Assessment Engine Verdict

The engine is **predominantly dynamic in process** but has a **closed type system for presentation**. Adding a new evaluation type requires:
1. Add to `EvaluationType` union type
2. Add to `evaluationTypeSchema` Zod enum
3. Create result view component with hardcoded field assumptions
4. Add `case` to `AttemptResultView.tsx` switch
5. Add label entries to `EVALUATION_TYPE_LABELS`

## UI/UX Issues

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parent dashboard stats show `—` | MEDIUM | `ParentDashboardScreen.tsx` | Children count and evaluations count show placeholder dash instead of actual data |
| No loading states on several pages | MEDIUM | Various | Many pages lack `loading.tsx` files. Admin dashboard, organization pages |
| No error states on several pages | MEDIUM | Various | Server-side pages that fail just show blank or `notFound()` |
| Empty state for tables inconsistent | LOW | Various | Some pages have proper empty states, some show raw "no data" text |
| Teacher `profileNotFound` state | MEDIUM | `TeacherClassesPage` | Shows hardcoded English "teacher profile not found" without proper empty state |
| `next/link` used instead of locale-aware Link | MEDIUM | `ChildrenScreen`, `ClassesScreenClient`, `ManagementPageHeader`, `EmptyState` | Risk of non-localized navigation |
| Hardcoded English strings in components | MEDIUM | `EvaluationBuilder.tsx`, `AnswerGroup.tsx`, `AdminDispatchNotificationScreen.tsx` | Strings like "You can take a maximum of 2 attempts per child" are not translatable |
| `console.log` in production code | LOW | Several route files | Debug logging in verify-email, tests, grades, employees pages |
| Hardcoded colors/gradients | LOW | Multiple dashboard screens | `bg-[#f3eefb]` repeated across layouts |
| RTL not fully tested in all components | MEDIUM | Sidebar, DataTable | Direction-dependent rendering may break in Arabic |
| Organization header fixed height coordination | LOW | `layout.tsx` | `pt-28` for fixed header — fragile if header height changes |

---

## Technical Debt

| Issue | Severity | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Route typo contracts | HIGH | `enums.ts`, `proxy.ts` | `unautharized`, `email-verfication`, `chose-role`, `Endpoint.VERIFYEMAIL = "verfy-email"`, `StatusCode.UNAUTHARIZED` — renaming will break routes |
| Committed `.env` file | HIGH | Repo root | Secrets committed to repository |
| JSON-only API wrappers | HIGH | `client-api-client.ts`, `server-api-clent.ts` | `204 No Content` or empty responses will throw errors |
| ParentSignup component is empty | HIGH | `ParentSignupForm.tsx` | Returns `<div>ParentSignup</div>` — no actual form |
| Authentication logic duplication | MEDIUM | `proxy.ts` vs `redirects.ts` | Role home mapping duplicated |
| Mixed server actions and React Query | MEDIUM | Various | Cache invalidation and server props can drift |
| Feature types sprawl | MEDIUM | `lib/types/types/interfaces.ts` vs feature types | Overlapping type definitions |
| No global query defaults | MEDIUM | `QueryClientProvider.tsx` | Each query must remember stale/refetch behavior |
| Organization sidebar dead links | LOW | `organization-sidebar.tsx` | Analytics, Projects, Team, Settings, Help, Search links all point to `#` |
| Form field abstraction gaps | MEDIUM | `RhfFormFields.tsx` | Select/textarea/checkbox not as tightly integrated as text/password/phone |
| No file upload support | MEDIUM | API wrappers | `InputTypes.FILE` and `InputTypes.IMAGE` exist but wrappers force JSON |
| `Tests` feature appears unused | LOW | `src/app/[locale]/tests/page.tsx` | Test route exists but may be deprecated or unused |
| `flow-6` route | LOW | `src/app/[locale]/flow-6/page.tsx` | Enigmatic route — likely legacy/demo |

## Safe Mock Implementations

For missing features, the following mock implementations follow existing project conventions:

### Mock 1: Service Provider Feature Skeleton
```txt
src/features/provider/
  api/index.ts          -> Mock API with dummy provider data
  hooks/index.ts         -> useProviders(), useProviderApproval()
  components/
    provider-sidebar.tsx -> Nav items: Dashboard, Deals, Proposals, Attendance
  types/index.ts         -> Provider, ProviderStatus interfaces
  index.ts
```

Following pattern from `src/features/teachers/` and `src/features/organizations/`.

### Mock 2: Deal Feature Skeleton
```txt
src/features/deals/
  api/index.ts           -> Mock CRUD for deals
  hooks/index.ts          -> useDeals(), useCreateDeal()
  components/
    DealCard.tsx          -> Using shared EntityCard pattern
    DealForm.tsx          -> Using ServerActionForm pattern
    columns.tsx           -> TanStack table columns
  types/index.ts
  index.ts
```

Following pattern from `src/features/grades/` and `src/features/classes/`.

### Mock 3: Audit Log Viewer
```txt
src/app/[locale]/dashboards/admin/audit-logs/page.tsx
src/features/audit-logs/
  api/index.ts
  hooks/index.ts
  components/columns.tsx
```

Following DataTable pattern from admin pages.

### Mock 4: Admin Payment Approval
```txt
src/app/[locale]/dashboards/admin/payments/page.tsx
src/features/payments/
  components/
    AdminPaymentsScreen.tsx   -> Review/approve payments table
```

Existing `src/features/payments/` already has API and hooks scaffolding.

---

## Final Production Readiness Score

### Score: 43/100 — NOT READY FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION

### Reasons WHY:

1. **Entire actors missing**: Service Provider/Enricher role has zero implementation. The domain document defines this as a core actor with a multi-step lifecycle. Backend integration would fail because the frontend cannot represent, authenticate, or display this actor.

2. **Entire subdomain missing**: Deal/Proposal lifecycle is completely absent. This is a major business workflow that involves Organization, Service Provider, and Admin interactions — three of the five defined actors.

3. **Empty parent registration form**: `ParentSignupForm.tsx` is a stub (`<div>ParentSignup</div>`). Independent parent registration via signup wizard selects "parent" type but renders nothing usable.

4. **Payment flow disconnected**: PaymentService exists but is orphaned — no admin payment dashboard, no payment approval, no capacity-increase payment flow. The payment domain requirement "Admin handling payment approvals, sending payment links" has no frontend implementation.

5. **Closed assessment type system**: Adding new evaluation types requires code changes in 5+ files. The architecture claims to support "Dynamic Questions, Dynamic Answer Types, Dynamic Scoring, Dynamic Reports" but result visualization is hardcoded for 6 specific types.

6. **Route typo contracts baked in**: `unautharized`, `email-verfication`, `chose-role` are actual route segments referenced across the codebase. Backend API routes would need to match these typos or a redirect layer must be maintained.

7. **Audit logging missing**: BR-10 requires critical actions to be audit logged. No frontend audit viewer exists.

8. **Teacher role incomplete**: Teacher cannot evaluate children, view evaluations, or send reminders — three of the four teacher responsibilities defined in the domain.

9. **Committed `.env` with secrets**: Production security concern.

10. **JSON-only API contract assumption**: Empty responses and `void` mutations will crash the API clients.

### What IS ready:

- Organization CRUD (grades, classes, children, teachers, employees, results)
- Admin organization approval flow
- Parent child management (private + org children)
- Evaluation attempt flow (start → run → save → submit → approve → view results)
- Notification system (dispatch, list, bell, read)
- Basic RBAC for ADMIN, ORGANIZATIONOWNER, TEACHER, PARENT

### Verdict

**NOT READY FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION** until the following minimum criteria are met:

1. Add missing `ENRICHER` role and feature scaffold
2. Implement parent registration form (currently empty stub)
3. Create deal/proposal feature scaffold
4. Implement teacher evaluation access
5. Connect payment flow to admin dashboard
